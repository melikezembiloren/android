###  DEPENDENCY INJECTION WITH HILT 

Dependency Injection (DI) is a technique widely used n programming and well-suited to Android development.

Implementing dependency injection provides the reusability of code, ease Ä±f refactoring and ease of testing.

Doing manual dependency injection or service locators in a Android app requires to consturct every class and its dependencies by hand, and to use containers to reuse and manage dependencies.

Hilt is a dependency injection library, built on top of the popular DI library dagger, that reduce the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in project. 

In summary, in the hilt, the required dependencies are created as modules and used by injecting them where needed.

## ADDING DEPENDENCIES OF HILT 

* In build.gradle.kts (Project) file

```
plugins{
  ...
  id ("com.google.dagger.hilt.android") version "$hilt_version" apply false

```

* In build.gradle.kts (Module) file

```
plugins {
  ...
  kotlin("kapt")
  id("com.google.dagger.hilt.android")
}
```

```
dependencies{
  ...
  implementation("com.google.dagger:hilt-android:$hilt_version")
  kapt("com.google.dagger:hilt-compiler:$hilt_version")
}
```

```
kapt{
  correctErrorTypes = true
}
```

### HILT IN ACTION

# 1. @HiltAndroidApp
  First, replace your default application with a Dagger Hilt annotated one. The @HiltAndroidApp annotation is used to mark the application class in project. 

  This annotation is crucial for initalizing the Hilt component. When you apply @HiltAndroidApp to your Application class, Hilts sets up the necessary Dagger 2 components and modules for dependency injection.

  ```
  @HiltAndroidApp
  class MyApplication : Application()
  {
    ...
  }
